# fMRI-AmyloidPET-AD-Phase-1-Literature-Review
This project explores the intersection between functional MRI (fMRI)  and  Amyloid PET imaging to identify  common neural biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).   The work combines graph theory, deep learning, and multimodal neuroimaging  approaches to understand how  functional network disruptions relate to  amyloid-beta deposition in the brain.
